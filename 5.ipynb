    "Hyperplane:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a binary classification problem with two features, a hyperplane is a line that separates the data into two classes. In three dimensions, it becomes a plane, and in higher dimensions, it's a hyperplane.\n",
    "Visualize a 2D plot where points of two classes are separated by a straight line.\n",
    "Marginal Plane:\n",
    "\n",
    "The marginal plane in SVM represents the region that is equidistant from the hyperplane. This distance is known as the margin.\n",
    "On your graph, visualize two parallel lines on either side of the hyperplane, indicating the margin.\n",
    "Hard Margin SVM:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a hard margin SVM, the goal is to find a hyperplane that maximally separates the classes without any misclassifications.\n",
    "On your graph, the margin is rigid, and no data points are allowed within the margin or on the wrong side of the hyperplane.\n",
    "Soft Margin SVM:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a soft margin SVM, some allowance for misclassifications is made to handle noisy or overlapping data.\n",
    "On your graph, allow for a certain number of data points to be within the margin or even on the wrong side, introducing a \"softness\" to the margin.\n",
    "Here's a general approach to visualize these concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a scatter plot with points from two classes.\n",
    "Draw the hyperplane that separates the classes.\n",
    "For the margin, draw two parallel lines on each side of the hyperplane.\n",
    "For a hard margin, ensure no points are within the margin or on the wrong side.\n",
    "For a soft margin, allow for some misclassifications within the margin."
