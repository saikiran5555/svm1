    "In Support Vector Machines (SVM), support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane) and play a crucial role in determining the optimal hyperplane. The decision boundary is chosen in such a way that it maximizes the margin, which is the distance between the decision boundary and the nearest data points of each class, i.e., the support vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The role of support vectors can be explained through the following key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Determination of the Margin:\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin is the distance between the decision boundary and the nearest support vectors of each class.\n",
    "SVM aims to maximize this margin during the training process, making the model more robust and improving its generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "Defining the Decision Boundary:\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision boundary is determined by the support vectors, and it is positioned to maximize the margin between classes.\n",
    "Changes in the position of other data points, which are not support vectors, may not affect the location of the decision boundary.\n",
    "Robustness and Generalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vectors are critical in ensuring the robustness of the model because they are the most influential data points.\n",
    "SVM focuses on correctly classifying these crucial points, making the model less sensitive to outliers and noise in the data.\n",
    "Sparsity in Model Representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs are often sparse, meaning that the majority of the training data does not contribute to defining the decision boundary.\n",
    "Only the support vectors have non-zero coefficients in the representation of the hyperplane, leading to a more efficient and memory-effective model.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a binary classification problem with two classes, positive (+1) and negative (-1), and a 2-dimensional feature space. The support vectors are the data points closest to the decision boundary.\n",
